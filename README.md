# Simple Todo App

This is a simple todo app created using [React](https://reactjs.org). It currently only supports adding items (by using the input form) and deleting items (by clicking on an item).

This project was meant as a way for me to learn how a React project works, nothing more than that.

# Acknowledgments

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Thanks to [Coolors](https://coolors.co) for helping an extremely design-challenged programmer generate a color scheme that isn't a abomination.

Thanks to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) for letting me generate a favicon for this app.
